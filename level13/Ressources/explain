By running the level13 binary we can see that it check the UID.
With strings we see the libc.so loaded, so we can inject another dinamic library with the getuid returning 4242.
the source code is in exploit.c.

We can inject it simply :

```
cd /tmp/;
gcc -shared -o /tmp/exploit.so /tmp/exploit.c;
gdb ~/level13
```

we run the binary with gdb and the flag is displayed.

```
Starting program: /home/user/level13/level13
your token is 2A31L79asukciNyi8uppkEuSx
