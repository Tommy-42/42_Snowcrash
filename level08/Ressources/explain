We start with a binary and a token file, we see that the binary can read almost any file

We can see by using `strings` that the string 'token' is hardcoded and next to it the string 'You may not access '%s''
We can assume that the program refuse any given file with 'token' in it

```
level08@SnowCrash:~$ echo 'toto' > /tmp/token; ./level08 /tmp/token
You may not access '/tmp/token'
```

We got it right, now we simply create a symbolic link, without token in it  and read it.

```
level08@SnowCrash:~$ ln -s ~/token /tmp/toto; ./level08 /tmp/toto
quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean
```

We got a token, but not the flag (we can't connect to the user level09)

so simply `su flag08` with quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean as the password and launch getflag
