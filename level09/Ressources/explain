We can see by login that we have one binary and one token file, we can read the token but it look like it's encrypted

We try to pass some input to the binary

```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 aaaaa
abcde
```

We can imediatly see what append, it move the character by it's index in the string so we can build a simple python script that will reverse the encrypted file

```
import sys

for i, val in enumerate(sys.argv[1]):
	sys.stdout.write(chr(ord(val)-i))
	sys.stdout.flush()
print

```

We run it and obtain the token

```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ python /tmp/script.py `cat token`
f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq
```


now we connect as flag09 and launch getflag


```
Don't forget to launch getflag !
flag09@SnowCrash:~$ getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : s5cAJpM8ev6XHw998pRWG728z
