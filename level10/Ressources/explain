We can see by usings strings that the binary comunicate a file over a socket on the port 6969,
If we try to send the token


```
level10@SnowCrash:~$ ./level10 token 129.0.0.1
You don't have access to token
```

We can see that the program check if we have the right to read the file,
It's possible to trick him by swaping a fake file with the right and the token in between the right checking and the reading and sending over the socket
As an annex you can see the script that I use.
It create the swap file with the same header as the binary send
Open a netcat loop that will remove all headers occurences and put it in a file, then put all that in a job
It loop over the binary by sending the swap file on localhost:6969 and put it into a job
then it swap the swap file and the token

You can now sinply run it and wait few seconds then kill it and cat the token file, without forgetting to remove the blanks

```
level10@SnowCrash:~$ cat /tmp/token | grep [^[:blank:]]
woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c
...
```

And we can see multiple time the content of ~/token, now we login and getflag

Don't forget to launch getflag !
flag10@SnowCrash:~$ getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : feulo4b72j7edeahuete3no7c
